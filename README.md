## Hey Everyone  👋

I'm Rishabh, Computer Science (Data Science) undergraduate who enjoys building things on the web. I like working on full-stack projects, turning ideas into useful, real-world applications, and learning by actually building stuff. Right now, I’m creating projects using the MERN stack and improving my understanding of how modern web apps are structured.  

Currently Learning -
- State management using Zustand
- Next.js for building production-ready React apps
- TypeScript to write cleaner and more reliable code

Mostly focused on writing better code, understanding best practices, and getting comfortable with real-world workflows.
